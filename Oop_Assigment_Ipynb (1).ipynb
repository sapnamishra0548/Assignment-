        "a) Class:- This is a blueprint or template that is used to create objects. This defines what properties (variable) and methods (functions) the object will have.\n",
        "\n",
        "b) Object:- An objet is a real world entity that is an instance of a class. Every object is uses the properties of its class.\n",
        "\n",
        "c) Encapsulation:- Encapsulation means bandagings data and methods into a single unit(class). Instead of directly accesing the data, it is controlled through methods, which increases security.\n",
        "\n",
        "d) Inheritance:- This is a process by which one class can inherit the properties and methods of another class. This resets the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "e) Polymorphism:- Pplymorphism means that the same method can be implemented by different object in their own way.\"Poly\" means \"many\" and \"morph\" means \"forms\".\n",
